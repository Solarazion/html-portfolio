<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jason Broome, i am 31 and am looking for a career change from networking to codeing. I have 4 kids which 
  is a shock to most people i know but having a lively house and those little personalities running around is what has spurred
  me on to challenge my self and pursue what i have always been passionate about doing which is coding! I did attempt this in the past
  but due to a lack of students on the course it was unfortunately closed. But this didnt stop me there instead i took to looking online to see what
  information and material was readily available for me to code along too and try pick it up that way this involved "Code Academy" and of recent
  "Udemy" with other thousands of courses which covered basic to mastery in various codeing languages, this lit a fire in me as i wanna prove 
  to myself and the kids that your never to old to upskill. My end goal is to learn and have nailed down the foundation concepts of coding being
  "HTML","CSS" and "Javascript" and work towards being professional web developer.

<p>When i am not studying or working a full time job in IT as a support agent as of recent. I am out with my partner and kids going to
   restraunts and play areas, as these places are a place of comfort for the parent and aswell a fun spot for the kids to burn that energy
   off. We have recently decided to take up swimming as a family as teaching the kids to swim is an essential and fun skill to have expecially
   when on holiday!

<p>This portfolio website was designed and is kept upto date by myself through sheer hardwork and tenacity and persoverance, as this showcases the projects ive worked on
   to completion and the skillsets i have honed through selftaught methods. I plan to keep upskilling and taking on new challenges to see just
   what else i am capable of doing. So potential employers watch this space as new and interesting projects ill take on will be inovative and are on the horizon.
